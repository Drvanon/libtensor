To build CTF on a standard linux setup simply run make in the top directory.

To specialize the build configuration (for instance set a custom BLAS library
or specify MPI compiler), one must set up a config.mk file. Examples and 
premade config.mk files for a few architectures are located in the 
mkfiles/ subdirectory. On running make without a config.mk file in the top
folder, mkfiles/config.mk.linux will be copied to config.mk in the top folder.
This file will not be overwritten.

The CTF library is built by default and will be located in lib/. The main 
interface to the library is include/ctf.hpp.

Run 'make examples' to build example programs, see examples/ dir for full list
(any one of them can be built individually by the command 'make <example_name>'. 
Any executables that are build will appear in bin/
